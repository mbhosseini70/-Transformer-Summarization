This project is a straightforward and simple implementation of web article summarization. It showcases several strengths:

1. **Easy Customization**: You have the flexibility to change the URL of the web article you want to summarize, making it adaptable to various sources.

2. **Transformer-based Model**: The code utilizes a transformer-based model from HuggingFace's Transformers library, which is known for its state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks.

3. **Web Scraping**: It employs the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping, enabling you to extract content from any web article.

4. **Content Preprocessing**: The scraped content undergoes preprocessing, including conversion to lowercase and punctuation removal, to prepare it for the summarization model.

5. **Chunking**: To handle longer articles effectively, the code splits the content into manageable chunks before summarization.

6. **Comprehensive Summaries**: It generates concise summaries for each chunk and concatenates them to provide a comprehensive summary of the entire article.
